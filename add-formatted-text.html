    <pre>
                Each morning I get up I die a little
                Can barely stand on my feet
                (Take a look at yourself)
                Take a look in the mirror and cry (and cry)
                Lord, what you're doing to me (yeah yeah)
            
                I have spent all my years in believing you
                But I just can't get no relief, Lord
                Somebody (somebody)
                Ooh somebody (somebody)
                Can anybody find me somebody to love?
               
                I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life
                I work till I ache my bones
                At the end, (at the end of the day)
                I take home my hard earned pay all on my own
                I go down (down) on my knees (knees)
               
                And I start to pray
                Till the tears run down from my eyes Lord
                Somebody, (somebody)
                Ooh somebody (somebody)
                Yeah! Can anybody find me somebody to love?
                I try and I try and I try
                But everybody wants to put me down
                They say I'm goin' crazy
                They say I got a lot of water in my brain
