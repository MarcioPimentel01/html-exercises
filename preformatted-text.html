                Each morning I get up I die a little
                Can barely stand on my feet
                (Take a look at yourself)
                Take a look in the mirror and cry (and cry)
                Lord, what you're doing to me (yeah yeah)
            
                I have spent all my years in believing you
                But I just can't get no relief, Lord
                Somebody (somebody)
                Ooh somebody (somebody)
                Can anybody find me somebody to love?
               
                I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life
                I work till I ache my bones
                At the end, (at the end of the day)
                I take home my hard earned pay all on my own
                I go down (down) on my knees (knees)
               
                And I start to pray
                Till the tears run down from my eyes Lord
                Somebody, (somebody)
                Ooh somebody (somebody)
                Yeah! Can anybody find me somebody to love?
                I try and I try and I try
                But everybody wants to put me down
                They say I'm goin' crazy
                They say I got a lot of water in my brain

  <h3>Please see the code below</h3>

  The &lt;pre&gt; element in HTML stands for "preformatted text." It is used to
  define text that should be displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier),
  and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
  <p>Here's how the &lt;pre&gt; element works:&lt;/p&gt;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Fixed-width Font: The text inside a &lt;pre&gt; element is typically
      displayed using a fixed-width font. This means each character takes up the
      same amount of space, making it useful for displaying text in a way that
      preserves formatting.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preserves Spaces: Unlike normal HTML rendering, the &lt;pre&gt; element
      preserves spaces, tabs, and line breaks exactly as they appear in the HTML
      code. This is beneficial when displaying code snippets, ASCII art, or any
      text where the exact spacing matters.
    </li>
    <li>
      In this example, the text inside the &lt;pre&gt; element is displayed with
      a fixed-width font, and the spaces and line breaks are maintained as they
      are in the HTML code.
    </li>
    <li>
      The &lt;pre&gt; element is commonly used when displaying code snippets,
      ASCII art, or any content where maintaining the exact spacing and
      formatting is crucial.
    </li>
    <br />
  </ol>
