  <h2>Please see explanation below</h2>

    <p>The given code snippet is written in HTML and defines a <strong>favicon</strong>. Here's a breakdown of its components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**&lt;link&gt;&nbsp;tag: This tag is used to link external resources to an HTML document.</li>
            <li>rel="icon"<strong>&nbsp;attribute:</strong>&nbsp;This attribute specifies the relationship between the linked resource and the document. In this case, "icon" indicates the resource is a favicon.</li>
            <li>type="image/ico"<strong>&nbsp;attribute:</strong>&nbsp;This attribute defines the MIME type of the linked resource, which in this case is an ICO image file.</li>
            <li>href="images/favicon.ico"<strong>&nbsp;attribute:</strong>&nbsp;This attribute specifies the location (relative path) of the icon file. Here, it suggests the file is located in a folder named "images" within the same directory as the HTML file, and its filename is "favicon.ico".</li>
        </ul>
    <p><strong>In summary, this code snippet links an ICO image file named "favicon.ico" located in the "images" folder as the favicon for the web page.</strong> The favicon is a small icon typically displayed in the browser tab or bookmark list, representing the website.</p>
