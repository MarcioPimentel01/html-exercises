                Each morning I get up I die a little
                Can barely stand on my feet
                (Take a look at yourself)
                Take a look in the mirror and cry (and cry)
                Lord, what you're doing to me (yeah yeah)
            
                I have spent all my years in believing you
                But I just can't get no relief, Lord
                Somebody (somebody)
                Ooh somebody (somebody)
                Can anybody find me somebody to love?
               
                I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life
                I work till I ache my bones
                At the end, (at the end of the day)
                I take home my hard earned pay all on my own
                I go down (down) on my knees (knees)
               
                And I start to pray
                Till the tears run down from my eyes Lord
                Somebody, (somebody)
                Ooh somebody (somebody)
                Yeah! Can anybody find me somebody to love?
                I try and I try and I try
                But everybody wants to put me down
                They say I'm goin' crazy
                They say I got a lot of water in my brain
               
                Ah they ain't got no common sense
                He's got nobody left to believe in
                (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
                Ooh ooh ooh ooh (Lord)
                Somebody (somebody, somebody)
                Can anybody find me, somebody to love?
                
                I got no feel, I got no rhythm
                I just keep losing my beat (you just keep on losing and losing)
                I'm alright, I'm alright (he's alright he's alright)
                I ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah yeah)
                I just gotta get out of this prison cell
                Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord
                Wanna hear every single person
                See every single of your hands
               
                Three, four!
                Find me somebody to love
                Find me somebody to love
                Find me somebody to love
                Find me somebody to love
                Find me somebody to love
                Find me somebody to love
                Find me somebody to love
                Find me somebody to love
                Somebody, (somebody)
                Somebody (somebody)
                Somebody find me
                Somebody find me
                Somebody to love
                
                Can anybody find me somebody to love?
                Yeah!
                (Find me somebody to love)
                (Find me somebody to love)
                Find me somebody, somebody, somebody to love
                Find me find, me find, me find, me find me
                Ooh somebody to love
                Anybody, any way
                Anybody find me somebody to love?
                Yeah, yeah
