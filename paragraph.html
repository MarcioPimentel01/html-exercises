  <h3>&lt;p&gt; Explanation</h3>

  <p>
    The &lt;p&gt; element in HTML is used to define a paragraph. It is a
    block-level element, which means it starts on a new line and typically
    stretches across the full width of its containing element.
  </p>

  <p>Here's a breakdown of how the &lt;p&gt; element works:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Opening Tag &lt;p&gt;:</strong> The &lt;p&gt; tag is the opening
      tag of the paragraph.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Content:</strong> The content of the paragraph goes between the
      opening &lt;p&gt; tag and the closing &lt;/p&gt; tag. This content can
      include text, links, images, and other inline or block-level elements.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Closing Tag &lt;/p&gt;:</strong> The &lt;/p&gt; tag is the closing
      tag that marks the end of the paragraph.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The &lt;p&gt; element is commonly used to structure and organize textual
    content on a webpage. It helps browsers and other user agents understand
    that the enclosed content forms a distinct paragraph, providing visual
    separation and aiding in the readability of the document.
  </p>

  <p>Here's a simple example of using &lt;p&gt; to create two paragraphs:</p>

  <p>
    In this example, the &lt;p&gt; tags define two separate paragraphs, and each
    paragraph starts on a new line. The browser typically adds some space above
    and below each paragraph, contributing to the visual separation.
